## Description
For this project, the application is a fitness tracker. The fitness tracker allows the user to login days and time spent at the gym. It also allows the user to login steps taken each day. The data inputed then is displayed onto two different charts. 
We were trying to create a user friendly application for the user to be able to easily track their progress.

## Future Development
Ultimately, we want this application to allow the user to log steps taken each day and track time spent exercising on two different charts using Charts.js, and allow longer length posts.
