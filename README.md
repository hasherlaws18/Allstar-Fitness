## Description and Purpose
For this project, the application is a fitness tracker. The fitness tracker allows the user to login days and time spent at the gym. It also allows the user to login steps taken each day. The data inputed then is displayed onto two different charts. 
We were trying to create a user friendly application for the user to be able to easily track their progress.
